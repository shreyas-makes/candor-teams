- Create tables **teams**, **users**, **feedbacks**, **invites** exactly as specced.
- **UNIQUE (author_id, recipient_id, week_start)** on feedbacks; disallow self-feedback.
- All FKs `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- Expose a model helper `Feedback#week_start` that snaps any Date/Time to the UTC-Monday of its week.
- Deleting feedback reopens that (author, recipient, week) slot.
