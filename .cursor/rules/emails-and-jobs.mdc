- Use **Action Mailer** + `sendgrid-ruby` v3 client only.
- **InviteMailer** and **FeedbackMailer** must enqueue via `deliver_later` (Delayed Job).
- Retry strategy: automatic **3× exponential back-off** on any non-2 xx response from SendGrid.
- Include signed score (±) in notification subject; body = first 250 chars then “…View in app”.
- Invite tokens expire **48 h** after creation; mail must state expiry clearly.
